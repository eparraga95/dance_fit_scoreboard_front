# Dance Fit Scoreboard Front

## The Idea

As explained better in [Dance Fit Scoreboard API](https://github.com/eparraga95/dance_fit_scoreboard_api)'s README, this project has the intention to be UI that connects players from [Dance Fit Gaming House](https://www.instagram.com/dancefitgaming.house/).

Developed in TypeScript with React, I intend to build the hub where the DFH players can store their Score's data from official Events held at the place.
